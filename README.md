Wallet Tracker is a powerful, open-source application designed to proactively monitor wallets accross evm blockchains and keep tabs on suspicious or lucrative on chain acitvity. It provides real-time alerts based off parameters you set, protecting the community and yourself before interacting with malicous contracts and helping degens safeguard their crypto. I will create a living document/guide to walk you through the setup and using wills wallet tracker.

Key Features
Real-time Monitoring: Continuously tracks your specified wallet addresses for incoming and outgoing transactions.
Swap Detection: Identifies potential token swaps, alerting you to interactions with decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or potentially malicious contracts.
Proactive Security: Helps mitigate risks associated with phishing attacks, rug pulls, and unauthorized transactions.
Customizable Alerts: Receive notifications via [Specify Notification Methods: Email, Push Notifications, etc.] when suspicious activity is detected.
Open-Source: Transparent and community-driven development, allowing for contributions and audits.
Powered by AI (Optional): Utilizes a local Large Language Model (LLM) like Llama 2 to enhance swap detection accuracy and identify potentially harmful contract interactions. This feature is optional and requires additional setup.
Technologies Used
Next.js: A React framework for building fast and scalable web applications.
[Database Name]: (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) Used to store wallet addresses, transaction history, and alert preferences.
Snowscan/Etherscan API: Leverages block explorer APIs to fetch transaction data. Requires an API key.
[LLM Framework - if applicable]: (e.g., llama.cpp) Used to run a local Large Language Model for enhanced security this will continue to be a huge focus.
[Notification Service - if applicable]: (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging) Used to send push notifications.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js (v16 or higher): Required to run the Next.js application.
[Database Software]: Installed and configured.
Snowscan/Etherscan API Key: Obtain an API key from [Snowscan/Etherscan Website].
[LLM Framework - if applicable]: Installed and configured. Download the appropriate LLM model weights.
Git: Required for cloning the repository.
Installation
Clone the Repository:








Copy code


DATABASE_URL=[Your Database Connection String]
SNOWSCAN_API_KEY=[Your Snowscan API Key]
# Etherscan API key if you want to monitor Ethereum wallets as well
# ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=[Your Etherscan API Key]
# LLM related variables if you are using the LLM feature
# LLM_MODEL_PATH=[Path to your LLM model file]
Set up the Database:

Create a database and tables as defined in the application’s schema. (See lib/db.js or relevant database configuration files)
Run the Application:

Currently this will have to run on your local host, I am working on integrating LLM models to 
scan for malicous code and good trades.



Usage
Add Wallets: Enter the wallet addresses you want to monitor into the application.
Monitor Transactions: The application will automatically fetch and display the transaction history for your added wallets.
Receive Alerts: When a suspicious transaction is detected (e.g., a swap with a known malicious contract), you will receive an alert via [Specify Notification Method].
Review Alerts: Review the details of each alert to determine if further action is required.
Security Considerations
API Key Protection: Never commit your Snowscan/Etherscan API keys to a public repository. Store them securely in environment variables.
Database Security: Secure your database with strong passwords and appropriate access controls.
LLM Security (if applicable): Be aware of the potential risks associated with running a local LLM. Ensure the model is from a trusted source and is properly secured.
Regular Updates: Keep the application and its dependencies up to date to benefit from the latest security patches.
